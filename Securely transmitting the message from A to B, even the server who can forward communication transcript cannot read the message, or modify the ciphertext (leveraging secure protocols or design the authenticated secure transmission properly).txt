1. Choose a secure encryption algorithm
The first step is to choose a secure encryption algorithm  --> maybe AES or RSA. 

The encryption algorithm
- should have strong security guarantees
- should not be vulnerable to known attacks.


2. Generate a shared secret key
Both parties (A and B) need to generate a shared secret key that will be used to encrypt and decrypt the message. 
This key should: 
- be kept secret 
- not transmitted over the network.


3. Implement end-to-end encryption
- The message should be encrypted on A's device 
- decrypted on B's device, without being decrypted or read by the server. 
- End-to-end encryption ensures that the message can only be read by the intended recipient, even if the server is compromised.


4. Authenticate the message
To ensure that the message has not been modified during transmission:
- authenticate the message using a secure hash function, such as SHA-256. 
- The hash function should be applied to the message 
- The hash should be sent along with the encrypted message.


5. Use a secure key exchange protocol: 
When generating the shared secret key:
- use a secure key exchange protocol --> Diffie-Hellman (DH) or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) ?? 
- These protocols allow both parties to generate the same shared secret key without transmitting it over the network.


6. Use a secure transport layer protocol: To further protect against attacks, 
- use a secure transport layer protocol such as TLS/SSL to transmit the encrypted message. 
- This protocol provides encryption and authentication of the communication channel between A and B.
